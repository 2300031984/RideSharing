## Data Flow

### Creating a Scheduled Ride
1. User fills out ScheduleRide form
2. Frontend sends POST to `/api/rides/book-scheduled`
3. Backend creates RideRequest with `isScheduled=true`
4. Frontend saves to localStorage as backup
5. User is redirected to dashboard

### Viewing Scheduled Rides
1. User navigates to `/user/scheduled-rides`
2. Frontend fetches from `/api/rides/user/{userId}/scheduled`
3. If backend fails, falls back to localStorage
4. Rides are displayed with status information
5. User can filter and interact with rides

## Testing

- **Purpose**: Demonstrates functionality with mock data
- **Features**:
  - Status determination testing
  - Driver status testing
  - Filtering testing
  - Time calculation testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Navigate to `/user/scheduled-rides`
2. Use filter tabs to view different ride statuses
3. Test action buttons (reschedule, cancel, view details)
4. Verify driver information displays correctly
5. Check time calculations are accurate

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/rides/book-scheduled
- **Purpose**: Create a scheduled ride
- **Body**: 
  ```json

    "specialRequests": "Help with luggage"
  }
  ```

### GET /api/rides/user/{userId}/scheduled
